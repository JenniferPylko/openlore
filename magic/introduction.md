There are several ways of performing feats of magic that are relatively consistent across the multiverse. Magic involved manipulation of physical forces, usually involving [arcana](../taxonomy/impetiti/arcana/introduction.md), [cogita](../taxonomy/impetiti/arcana/introduction.md), and/or [hyperia](../taxonomy/impetiti/hyperia/introduction.md).

Some of the most common systems of magic were the following.

- [Alchemy](alchemy/introduction.md)
- [Arcane Engineering](arc-e/introduction.md)
- [Rune Carving](rune-carving/introduction.md)
- [Scriptum Magorum](scriptum-magorum/introduction.md)
