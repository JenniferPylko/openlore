# Empire and Worm

**Setting:** [Warble](../cosmology/conduits/warble/introduction.md)

If there's one thing about humanity, it's that whether they walk, run, or crawl, fate sidesteps. This is shared neither by higher nor lower creatures, who have come and gone across the ages. Gods may bring fate to her knees, yet only man can move her. Individuals live and die, but relentlessly, the human bloodline continues.

The Thousand Worms slept, as they always had.

In the Cornelian year 580, The Great Mage Olam saw stagnation. The Empire Animorum grasped the land and the sea. The only progress in the arcane for the last 50 years had been whittling fractional seconds off incantations of the scriptum magorum.

The divine remained ever out of reach. No mortal could contact the gods except by their own occasional whim.

The priest no longer received dogmatic truths. The mage no longer wrote innovative incantations. The rune-carver no longer discovered new glyphs. The spirit hierophant comfortably manipulated known elements. The alchemist imbibed his own liquors.

The Thousand Worms slept, as they always had.

Olam held a desperation within his soul, that of a caged animal. All he perceived was within the cage, and he knew not what lay outside it, nor what material formed the bars.
