# Fall of a Deity

The first thing I remember is the feeling of cotton surrounding me. The birth sarcophagus was dark, which gave me time to orient myself and process the instructions implanted in my mind. I noted who my supervisor would be, and my job title: "worship extraction technician". A bright line sliced through the darkness as my birth sarcophagus unsealed, and I shielded my eyes to acquaint myself with my new luminescent surroundings.

"Alright, get on with it. I don't have all eternity."

I glanced around, looking for the source of the voice. It appeared to come from the being in front of me, a lanky humanoid-looking entity wearing a blue-gray work shirt and holding a rag and spray bottle. They gestured at me with the spray bottle.

"Well? Get a move on. I gotta clean your incubator."

"Right, of course." I stammered apologetically. I tugged my belt upward along my hips an imperceptible amount and straightened my tie, then stepped out and onto the catwalk.

"Thank you..." I squinted to read the being's name tag, "Aigokeros".

"Pan is fine."

"What?"

"My name. Pan is fine."

"Alright. Thank you Pan."

The office building was a stark change from the industrial bowels of the incubation facility. I entered the elevator, then punched in the number of my destination floor, 8264345754, and leaned against the wall for the centuries-long wait. The elevator stopped a few times along the way for others to enter and leave. I pressed up against the wall and stared at the changing floor number in order to avoid any casual office chatter. I didn't really want to engage with the 5-foot-something lizard talking loudly into her mobile phone or the blazing inferno that took up most of the space and was emitting a constant scream.

At last the fire entity departed, leaving a layer of soot on the floor. The lizard was still on the phone.

"I *understand* you're recovering from a cataclysm, but you've had over 2 thousand years to prepare!"

Some muffled words came over the handset.

"What do you mean 'no one heeded the prophecy'? That's what prophecies are for, you heathen!"

More indistinct chatter.

"Listen: no more excuses. Get your worship up to quota or you can say goodbye to divine providence and holy miracles. This conversation is *over*."

She hung up, exhaled, put on a smile, and turned to me.

"Sorry about that. Mortals, y'know?"

I made a noncommittal noise, and a noncommittal gesture to go along with the noise.

The doors slid open and I stepped into a quiet foyer. In the center of the floor was a full-sized pomegranate tree, to the left there were stairs up to a second level, and ahead there were a pair of enormous glass doors which displayed the words "extraction division" in gold lettering. I approached and depressed the buzzer. The right-side door slowly opened with a whir. Inside, a being dressed similar to me sat behind a large curved desk.

"Name?" He asked.

"Kaeronothos, I'm the new worship technician?"

He handed me a lanyard and gestured with a pen at a pair of chairs off to the side.

"Have a seat. Agesilaos will be out in a bit to give you the tour."

I slipped the lanyard over my head and sat down, looking around. The overhead lights shone together in such a way that shadows seemed to be nonexistent, and the only sound was a soft background hum accompanied by the being who had greeted me tapping away at his desktop interface.

Footsteps approached, and moments later I was approached by someone in an all-black suit. I stood up and shook his hand. He grinned through a trimmed black beard flecked with ashen grays, and spoke while handing me a thick manila folder.

"Agesilaos. You must be our new hire. Let's get started."

It was a lot of information, but Agesilaos assured me I wouldn't have to remember it all. There would be extensive reference documentation available on the job. We were the first stop for souls departing living beings. It was a pretty simple process: souls came in, got fed into an extraction machine which separated accumulated worship from the soul, then labelled the soul with an identifier, its religion in life, and a piety score based on the quantity and quality of worship that could be extracted. The soul got sent off to the appropriate deity for further processing, usually to end up in an afterlife or reincarnated. Extracted worship was piped to the refinery for purification and what-have-you, and we were all paid a portion of the resultant thought fiber.

"Before the bureaucracy the whole process was done by small groups of deities, or sometimes even individual deities. They'd have to go through each soul and just eat up the worship, then deal with the leftover soul. Any deity that didn't have enough worshippers would just starve. This system, with a separation of duties where not everyone needs to be worshipped, is much more efficient."

My job was to maintain and repair the extraction machines. The lab had an older model as a testbed to learn the inner workings of it's hyperical system. Agesilaos told me that once I was comfortable with troubleshooting the machines, I could work on the production floor whenever I didn't have anything to do if I wanted to earn a little extra.

I had a combined office/workshop, which was pretty sweet. In addition to the main door, there was a powered large overhead door that could be opened in order to transport the extraction machines in and out. My desk was already stocked with a desktop interface, as well as various tools and supplies.
