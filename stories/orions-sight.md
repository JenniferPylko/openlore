# Orion's Sight

**Setting:** [Warble](../cosmology/conduits/warble/introduction.md)

Far back as I can remember, I knew I was meant to be a night dweller. Daylight was painfully bright, and I could barely tell what I saw. Even as I stayed mostly indoors, it became clear that the quality of "color" that was described to me existed outside my visual domain. It seemed others possessed a greater acuity of vision as well. Learning to read was difficult, and I required larger text than others. When my parents hired a healer-mage to try to fix my vision, we discovered that not only was the attempt unsuccessful, but I could perceive the invisible magic involved in the process. The healer-mage - Ivan, I believe his name was? - recognized this as the gift of Orion's Sight. Now, we didn't have an Orion in our little town, but the next town over, Belvedere, did.
