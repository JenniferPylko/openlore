# Orion's Sight

**Setting:** [Warble](../cosmology/conduits/warble/introduction.md)

Far back as I can remember, I knew I was meant to be a night dweller. Daylight was painfully bright, and I could barely tell what I saw. Even as I stayed mostly indoors, it became clear that the quality of "color" that was described to me existed outside my visual domain. It seemed others possessed a greater acuity of vision as well. Learning to read was difficult, and I required larger text than others. When my parents hired a healer-mage to try to fix my vision, we discovered that not only was the attempt unsuccessful, but I could perceive the invisible magic involved in the process. The healer-mage - Ivan, I believe his name was? - recognized this as the gift of Orion's Sight. Now, we didn't have an Orion in our little town who could train me, but the next town over, Belvedere, did.

My parents couldn't move- my father was a scribe locked into contract with the town of Sevath and he didn't have the money to buy it out. So, they left me at the door of an Orion known as Hanami when I was 12.

Hanami was a woman who looked at once middle-aged and ancient. She looked like she had stopped aging at 40 over 1000 years ago, and now age leaked through in nearly imperceptible ways. Her dark hair held streaks of white. She kept it short, shaving all but the top of her head, which she let only grow long enough that it would barely droop, with a straight razor.

She worked me hard, that's for sure. I spent 10 years learning the sword. Well, many different swords. She decided I had the most aptitude for swords that were long and thin, which I could use with 1 or 2 hands. I had to practice with swords of various materials selected for their magical properties- steel, lead, silver, bronze, glass, even wood. Besides the difference in balance and weight, some of these required different techniques and were optimal for different circumstances. Lead would dull easily, but it could sap certain magic. Glass would shatter if it hit something hard, but it was effective against some incorporeal beasts.

Wards were a must. Even though I had no magical ability, there were still certain substances that could protect against magic. Symbols drawn with blood and gypsum could offer some level of abjuration against spells. We borrowed what we could from knowledge of witchcraft and alchemy.

At 14 I got my own set of side-lenses. An improvement over my darkened goggles, these had different types of lenses which could be rotated in or out of place and combined for multiple effects. There were, of course, darkened lenses for use during the day or any other high-light situation. There were magnifying lenses and telescopic lenses. Finally, there were lenses that were mismatched between left and right. The left one darkened certain things, like skin or fire. The right one darkened other things, like the sky or leaves. Though it didn't let me perceive color the way most people could, using one or both of these lenses let me distinguish color to a small degree. That's very important when you have a bottle of blue vitriol and a bottle of red vitriol with no labels.

The first time I actually had to fight a beast was at 15 years old. Before then Hanami had been dealing with these things on her own. It happened when a doctor's student by the name of Teriac had traveled from Sevath to get help. It was late in the evening when I heard the knocker - tap! tap! tap! - at the door. I looked up from my work mixing a minium ink. Again - tap! tap! tap! - the knock came. I stood up, wiped my mildly stained hands on my protective apron, flipped my magnifying lenses to the side, and walked over to unlatch the door. The doctor's student stood there, holding a storm lantern. She introduced herself, and said she was looking for the Orion that lived in the house. I told her I was the Orion's apprentice, and invited her in.

She extinguished her lantern and shed her dark cloak.

"Elder is going to want some tea, so I'm putting the kettle on." I informed her. "Would you care for any yourself?"

"No, thank you." Teriac answered, subtly wringing her hands and glancing around.

"Just give me one moment to fetch her. Sit." I gestured at the chairs we kept by the hearth.

I picked up a candle and slipped out the door of the entrance parlor which led to the main hallway. I was fairly certain Hanami would be in her study, so I knocked twice and pushed the door open. My flickering candle spilled into the darkness, making shadows dance around the room. Hanami was at her desk, studying a tome holding faintly glowing script.

A sigh.

"Yes?"

"A client's here, from Sevath. She's waiting in the parlor."

"Is she now? You invited her in?"

"Yes, Elder, I did."

"Did it not occur to you that she could be a vampire, or any manner of demon, waiting for an invitation in order to be able to enter and kill us?"

"I didn't see any undeath or profanity about her."

"Did it not then also occur to you that she could be masking her true nature?"

I paused. "Is that possible?"

"Well no, but, had any monsters discovered a way to make it possible, we'd both be dead."

"Noted. I did put the kettle on. Shall I inform her you'll be a while?"

"No, no. I'll walk with you." Hanami stood from her desk, and picked up her walking stick.

---

Now, I knew that the walking stick was purely ornamental, but Hanami began to lean on it and slow her gait once we reached the door to the parlor. Teriac was sitting by the hearth. Hanami and I both took seats opposite her.

"I am called Hanami. My apprentice tells me you're here because you need an Orion. That would be me."

"Uh, yes. There is some beastly presence in Sevath. There have been... attacks. Victims found mauled by some sort of ferocious animal. Claw marks and tooth marks. The watch and volunteers have been patrolling constantly, and people are too scared to leave their homes at night."

Hanami engaged with doubt, as usual. "Could it not be a wild animal? Perhaps a bear. Some of them can be quite large and vicious."

"No one's seen any such thing. And we've all been vigilant since the first attack."

"What about a person using bladed knuckles?"

"The lacerations tear through thick cloth and wood as well as flesh. No one in Sevath has that kind of strength."

"That you know of. Well, Serran, what do you think this could be?"

"Perhaps something that appears human most of the time, but transforms when killing." I answered. "A lycanthrope, possibly."

"Yes, could be. Tell me" - "Teriac" - "Teriac, what was the moon phase when this started?"

"Waning, less than a half moon."

"Hmm. We are mere days past the summer solstice. This could be a Song phenomenon, not a Silence one." Hanami reasoned aloud. "Nothing left behind by the attacker? Fur, blood, bits of cloth, that type of thing?"

"Nothing of the sort."

"Very well. We don't have a lot to work with. Serran, pack a bit of each of the salts, vitriols, oils, and aquas from the alchemy supply. Pack some sage, belladonna, wormwood, and cedar from the witchcraft supply. Holy water, a few holy symbols. The blades. We depart in the morning."

"We? I'm coming with you on this one?"

"That you are." A pause. "Your memory of Sevath may prove useful in our investigation."

"Yes, Elder." I responded with a tinge of surprise in my voice. Hanami started to plod out of the room, and Teriac fidgeted.

"I'll show you out." I volunteered.

"R- Right." She stood up and followed me to the door.

"There's an inn just inside the gate of Belvedere proper, if you're not yet going to return to Sevath." I said, trying to be helpful.

"Thank you." She said through a half smile. I closed the door and turned around to see Hanami standing there.

"She looks to be about your age. Don't go getting *ideas*."

"Ideas, Elder?"

"Romance, lust, that sort of thing. Demons love that shit."

"Noted. I don't think I'm much of an ideas woman anyway."

The ride was uneventful. I had packed everything Hanami asked me to, and we set forth with a horse and cart the town of Belvedere had so generously let us borrow. I'm pretty sure Hanami coerced them somehow, perhaps guilting them into it after taking care of a few monsters, but when I asked her about it she only told me that being an Orion was a good job, and nothing else.
