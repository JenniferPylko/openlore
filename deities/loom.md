Loom was the first deity and the only known type I deity. Loom created the first mortals, but could not easily communicate with them, for its mind was too alien. It created [Ere](ere.md) to bridge that gap of understanding.

## Origin

Loom formed from the tangled mind fibers of the [mental dimension](../cosmology/introduction.md#the-mental-dimension). It created the [divine realm](../cosmology/introduction.md#the-divine-realm) as a space to anchor itself to. It created the first mortals in an attempt to produce mind fiber for it to consume, but it was unable to create mortals who would self-perpetuate. In order to do so, it created [Ere](ere.md) to solve that problem. It then withdrew from any interaction with mortals or even other deities, feeding off the mind fiber given to it by Ere.
