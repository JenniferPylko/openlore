Elfemroth was a type IIa [holy-aligned](../../../taxonomy/illustrati/incorporia/staminea/holy/introduction.md) deity created by [Loom](loom.md). He and [Ere](ere.md) created many conduits with mortals, starting with [prototype earth](../../../cosmology/conduits/prototype-earth.md). Once humans had come into existence on prototype earth, they were used as a template for a large number of other sapient mortals. One of these first variants was the elf, created by Elfemroth. Elves in many conduits worshipped Elfemroth under various names.
