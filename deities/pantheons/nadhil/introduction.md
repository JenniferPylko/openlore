# The Nadhil Pantheon

<meta property="og:description" content="">

The Nadhil Pantheon was worshipped across several [conduits](../../../cosmology/conduits/introduction.md), most often by peoples who would be considered elven or fae. Deity names in this pantheon usually have the suffix -il or -ir, the former applying to major deities and the latter applying to minor deities, "Nadhil" itself roughly meaning "divine harbinger".
