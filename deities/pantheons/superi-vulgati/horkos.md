Horkos, king of the inferno, was a [type IIa](../../introduction.md#type-iia-deity-constructed) [profane-aligned](../../../taxonomy/illustrati/incorporia/staminea/profane/introduction.md) deity. He ruled the hells of the multiverse.

## Origin

Horkos originally ran the extraction division of the celestial bureaucracy as Agesilaos, but after finding out from [Kaeronothos](karun.md) about the fraud going on, he was rebuilt as Horkos to direct the hell project. Once he was Horkos, he managed everything profane within the celestial bureaucracy.
