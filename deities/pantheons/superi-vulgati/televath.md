Televath was a type IIIa deity whose domains included chaos, the afterlife, whimsy, and change. In life she was a powerful mage of Warble named Isabella, though she demanded her followers call her "Witch-Queen Ella". Her desire for power led to Thullanoth choosing her for apotheosis, as he thought she would be less trouble as a deity than as a mortal.
