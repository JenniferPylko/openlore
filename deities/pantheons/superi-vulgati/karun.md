Karun, the demonic lord of death, was a [type IIa](../../introduction.md#type-iia-deity-constructed) [profane-aligned](../../../taxonomy/illustrati/incorporia/staminea/profane/introduction.md) deity.

## Origin

Karun was first Kaeronothos, a deity working under [Agesilaos](horkos.md) in the celestial bureaucracy's extraction division, repairing machines that extracted worship from the souls of dead mortals. He found some odd glitches and discrepancies in the worship processing system, and eventually found out that a large amount of the mind fiber processed from worship was going to [Loom](../primordial/loom.md) rather than being distributed to all the deities in the celestial bureaucracy. Once he confronted [Ere](../primordial/ere.md) and [Elfemroth](../primordial/elfemroth.md) about the fraud, he was rebuilt into Karun. As Karun he worked under [Horkos](horkos.md) in the hell project. Souls consigned to a profane afterlife were transported by Karun across the rivers of hell to their ultimate destination.
