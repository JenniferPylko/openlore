A deity, or god, is a specific type of being that subsists on mental energy fiber produced by thinking beings, while also existing as pure thought. The first of these was [Loom](loom.md), who created [Ere](ere.md) and [Elfemroth](elfemroth.md). Most deities are parasitic, gaining such sustenance through worship, though some are fully predatory or exhibit aspects of both parasitism and predation.

## Administrative System

Ere and Elfemroth created a great celestial bureaucracy to manage the distribution of mental energy fiber. This served 2 purposes: as the multiversal pantheons grew, this organization could make sure that deities actually got the mental energy fiber they were entitled to by worship from their followers, and also to tax this worship to direct some mental energy fiber to Loom, lest it raze the multiverse and start anew. Part of this celestial bureaucracy was the [Clock of Being](../cosmology/clock-of-being.md).

## Types

There are several types of deities, categorized mostly by how they came into existence.

### Type I (Emergent)

A Type I deity is one that forms from naturally occurring tangled thought fiber without outside influence. Loom is the only known Type I deity.

### Type II (Constructed)

Type II deities are similar to Type I, but constructed by another deity, mortal, or group of mortals.

#### Type IIa (Deity-constructed)

Type IIa deities are any deity constructed or resurrected by another deity.

#### Type IIb (Doxalotry-constructed)

Type IIb deities are created through mortal worship of something non-thinking, such as an idol, a concept, or a deity that is dead or does not exist yet.

### Type III (Apotheosized)

Type III deities are former mortals who underwent apotheosis to become a deity. Any deity that becomes mortal and then undergoes apotheosis to become a deity again is considered Type III, even if they were previously a different type.

#### Type IIIa (Deity-chosen)

Type IIIa deities are mortals who were promoted to godhood by another deity.

#### Type IIIb (Anthropolatry-chosen)

Type IIIb deities are mortals who underwent apotheosis as a result of worship by other mortals.

#### Type IIIc (Autoapotheosized)

Type IIIc deities are mortals who became gods through their own means. These deities typically die shortly after apotheosis due to a lack of worshippers.

#### Type IV (Dead)

Type IV deities are deities (or remains of deities) that did not maintain enough worship to retain their status, and did not change their existence into another form, such as a mortal. Type IV deities are discarded into the time stream by other deities in the divine realm. Type IV deities can become Type II deities under the right conditions.
