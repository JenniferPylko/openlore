# The Sisters of War

The Sisters of War were minor deities of Abrecis who ruled the island of Hy-Bresail in [Glassvale](../subconduits/glassvale.md).

## Danu

Danu, also called Morrigan (not to be confused with [Morgan](morgan.md)), was a goddess of prophecy, particularly that of fated death. Of the 3 Sisters of War, she saw the most worship during [the polytheistic era](../eras/polytheistic.md), and was thus the most powerful. Her servants were [spirits](../spirits/introduction.md) known as [banshees](../spirits/banshee.md).
