# Ashenal

The Ashenal (pl. Ashenal, adj. Ashenal) were an anthropoid species who were the original sapient inhabitants of Abrecis. They appeared mostly similar to humans, but with pointed ears and a wider range of skin tones. These skin tones included all shades of tan, brown, and black, in addition to dark shades of gray tinted purple or blue. They became known as elves to other races during the [prolific era](../eras/prolific.md).
