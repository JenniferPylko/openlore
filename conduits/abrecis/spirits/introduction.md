# Spirits

Spirits were a type of being with a physical form that was the result of magic. Some were very bestial, and some were nearly anthropoid. The nature of spirits being magical was such that similarly-minded spirits would gain similar appearances and abilities after long amounts of time. Spirits were categorized into types based on common attributes. Many spirits were originally mortals who became [spirits of the dead](dead.md), but some were constructed intentionally, usually by a deity or another spirit.
