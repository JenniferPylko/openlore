# First Hematic War

The first hematic war was a genocidal campaign initiated by [Ethrenal](../figures/ethrenal.md). The goal of Ethrenal and his forces was to retake for the [Ashenal](../anthropoids/ashenal.md), and subjugate, enslave, or eliminate [everyone else](../anthropoids/introduction.md). In addition, Ethrenal had dolmens destroyed in order to cut off access to [Glassvale](../subconduits/glassvale.md).
