# The Unfathomable Night

The Unfathomable Night is an [S4M](../../../cosmology/dimension-types.md#standard-4-manifold-s4m) [induced space](../../../cosmology/dimension-types.md#induced-space) characterized by death and dread. The geography is similar to [Abrecis Prime](../introduction.md), but lying on a flat plane. The center of this dimension is a dilated space full of darkness known as The Depths. The edge is bounded by an esoteric geography of stone and ice, always reshaping to push travelers back toward the center.
