# The Unfathomable Night

The Unfathomable Night was an [S4M](../../../cosmology/dimension-types.md#standard-4-manifold-s4m) [induced space](../../../cosmology/dimension-types.md#induced-space) characterized by death and dread. The geography was similar to [Abrecis Prime](../introduction.md), but lying on a flat plane. The center of this dimension was a dilated space full of darkness known as The Depths. The edge was bounded by an esoteric geography of stone and ice, always reshaping to push travelers back toward the center. After [Obsidis'](../deities/obsidis.md) apotheosis, [Ethrenal](../figures/ethrenal.md) was imprisoned in The Depths by her.
