# Atavistic Era

The atavistic era was a period of global recovery. With near-total extinction of multicellular life on Abrecis occurring during the [xerothermic era](xerothermic.md), the actions of [Obsidis](../deities/obsidis.md) to restore the oceans and cleanse the atmosphere effected a reversal of the gradual decline of biological populations and diversity.
