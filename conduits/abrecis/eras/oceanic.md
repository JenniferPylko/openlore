# Oceanic Era

This era lasted for approximately 1 billion years and was marked by vast ocean dotted with islands. The only species of people to exist were the [Ashenal](../anthropoids/ashenal.md), who only appeared a few million years before the end of this era.

## End

This era was ended by [Caer's Mistake](../cataclysms/caers-mistake.md). Global sea levels fell as the world cooled, beginning a geologic ice age known as the [schismatic era](schismatic.md).
