# Xerothermic Era

The xerothermic era was characterized by extreme environmental damage caused by [catabolic magic](../magic.md#catabolic). The oceans receded and disappeared, and the planet became mostly desert. [Obsidis](../deities/obsidis.md) eventually undid some of this damage, beginning the [Atavistic](atavistic.md) era, but even thousands of years later, the desertification was still evident.
