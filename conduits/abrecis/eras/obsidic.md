# Obsidic Era

After [Obsidis'](../figures/obsidis.md) [genocide](../wars/second-hematic.md) and [apotheosis](../deities/obsidis.md), [Obsidism](../religions/obsidism.md) became Abrecis' primary [religion](../religions/introduction.md). One of the express goals of early Obsidism was the conversion or elimination of those not of the faith.
