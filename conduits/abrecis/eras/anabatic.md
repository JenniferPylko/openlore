# Anabatic Era

This era began with the turning point of global [miasma](../miasma.md) contamination, when [Obsidis](../deities/obsidis.md) cleansed the air, took away [magic](../magic.md), and worked to erase all record of non-human [anthropoids](../anthropoids/introduction.md). [The Holy Obsidian Theocracy](../nations/holy-obsidian-theocracy.md) expanded across [Obsidia](../continents/obsidia.md), then colonized other continents. Approximately a millennium and a half into this era [United Daithia](../nations/united-daithia.md) was formed.
