# Religion

The first religions on Abrecis were pantheistic. That is, worshipping part of the natural world as gods.

After the [split](../cataclysms/caers-mistake.md) of the [Ashenal](../anthropoids/ashenal.md) into many [different species](../anthropoids/introduction.md), pantheistic faith sublimated into many polytheistic religions.
