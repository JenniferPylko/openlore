# The Stewards of Abrecis

The Stewards of Abrecis, or just The Stewards, were the human descendants of [The Betrayers](betrayers.md) who lived in [Daithia](../continents/daithia.md) before the continent was colonized by [Obsidia](../nations/holy-obsidian-theocracy.md). The Stewards continued The Betrayers' practice of ritualistic ear removal, but would do so during infancy.

## Society

The Stewards mythologized The Betrayers, who they called The Founders, and carried knowledge of [miasma](../miasma.md) through generations with oral tradition. They tasked themselves with protecting the miasma tombs of Daithia from outside discovery or access, knowing the dangers of miasma sickness. Though [Obsidis](../deities/obsidis.md) had removed all magic casting from the world, The Stewards could manipulate some permanent spells left in place by The Betrayers.

## Major Factions

Many of The Stewards, such as the Syroeb Federation, who occupied the Shajan Caldera, chose a strategy of isolationism. The Parados Crusade was an extremist group who would attempt to kill those who were desecrated, that is, anyone who entered pre-obsidian structures. The Parados Crusade primarily fought against the expansionism of [DTX](dtx.md), and [Anthony Hill](../figures/anthony-hill.md) propagandized the conflict in order to gain and cement power.
