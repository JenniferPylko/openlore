# Sangura

The continent of Sangura lay directly north of [Daithia](daithia.md), separated by a strait known as *the scar*. [Obsidia](../nations/holy-obsidian-theocracy.md) colonized this continent in the [1400s OA](../calendar.md#reckoning), and the [nation of Sangura](../nations/sangura.md) gained independence in the early 1500s.
