# Daithia

This continent fell mostly in the southern hemisphere, with its southwestern region existing opposite [Lothia](lothia.md). This point opposite Lothia was the epicenter of [Caer's Mistake](../cataclysms/caers-mistake.md).

## Pre-Continental Islands

## Initial Settlement

## Hematic Wars

[Ethrenal](../figures/ethrenal.md) spent most of his life in Daithia, first as a teacher of mages, then as a genocidal tyrant.

## Abandonment

## Later Colonization

After being uninhabited by any [anthropoids](../anthropoids/introduction.md) for centuries, the [Holy Obsidian Theocracy](../nations/holy-obsidian-theocracy.md) re-discovered the continent and began to colonize it.

## Independence from Obsidia

## Miasma Tombs

Along with destroying as much evidence of civilization as possible, [Obsidis](../figures/obsidis.md) collected the [miasma](../miasma.md) that pervaded the world and concentrated it in tombs she buried beneath the sands of Daithia. In 1654 NA, the first of these was discovered near the town of Thunderperch in the foothills of the Westcolumn mountains. When unidentified interlopers began killing archaeologists and people who spent time in and near the tomb started getting sick, [TTX]() sent fixers to Thunderperch to make the planned route of the railroad safe to travel.
