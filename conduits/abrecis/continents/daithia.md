# Daithia

This continent fell mostly in the southern hemisphere, with its southwestern region existing opposite [Lothia](lothia.md). This point opposite Lothia was the epicenter of [Caer's Mistake](../cataclysms/caers-mistake.md).

## Pre-Continental Islands

## Initial Settlement

## Hematic Wars

[Ethrenal](../figures/ethrenal.md) spent most of his life in Daithia, first as a teacher of mages, then as a genocidal tyrant.

## Abandonment

## Later Colonization

After being uninhabited by any [anthropoids](../anthropoids/introduction.md) for centuries, the [Holy Obsidian Theocracy](../nations/holy-obsidian-theocracy.md) re-discovered the continent and began to colonize it.

## Independence from Obsidia

The previously-Obsidian colonies on Daithia formed a new country, [United Daithia](../nations/united-daithia.md).

## Miasma Tombs

In 1654 NA, the first of these was discovered near the town of Thunderperch in the foothills of the Westcolumn mountains. When unidentified interlopers began killing archaeologists and people who spent time in and near the tomb started getting sick, DTX sent fixers to Thunderperch to make the planned route of the railroad safe to travel.
