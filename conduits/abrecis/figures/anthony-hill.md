# Anthony Hill

> *Both workers and soldiers die every day, but soldiers get memorials. I wake up every day and choose the life of the latter. Military-man to military-man, if you don't know which one you want to be then you'd best get your priorities straight.*

Anthony Hill was a [DTX](../groups/dtx.md) contractor and former soldier who spearheaded the Westcolumn Mountain Tunneling Project. He was exceptionally charismatic, and would give the impression of someone easygoing and earnest. He saw anyone he couldn't charm as a potential threat, and would quickly resort to intimidation and brutality in order to maintain social dominance. As a leader, he heavily relied on fascist rhetoric and propaganda, particularly by causing conflict and then framing a chosen side as the aggressor in order to unify opinion to his side.
