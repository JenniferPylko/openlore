# Caer

Caer was an [Ashenal](../anthropoids/ashenal.md) mage who caused the [first cataclysm of Abrecis](../cataclysms/caers-mistake.md), earning him the moniker `The First Mistake`.

## Life Events

Caer was born on an island that would become [Daithia](../continents/daithia.md) and spent most of his life there, although he traveled to the islands that would become [Lothia](../continents/lothia.md), [Sangura](../continents/sangura.md), and [Atrea (Obsidia)](../continents/obsidia.md).

He died during Caer's mistake, as did everyone within several miles of the epicenter.
