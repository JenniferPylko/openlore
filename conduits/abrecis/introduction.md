# Abrecis

Abrecis (adj. Abrecian) was a world full of magic that fell into ruin as a result of the actions of its inhabitants. Any story taking place before or during the [Hematic era](eras/hematic.md) will be tinged a shade darker than a fantasy story may normally be, due to the presence or inevitability of the [Hematic wars](wars/introduction.md#hematic-wars). The [geography](geography.md) shifted very suddenly on multiple occasions.

Abrecis had 2 moons: [Shaj](moons/shaj.md) and [Nyvol](moons/nyvol.md). The moons played a part in the [Abrecian hybrid calendar system](calendar.md), with their orbital procession each marking multi-year cycles.

## The System

The [great primordial entity](deities/creator.md) created the sun and planets of the [Abrecis system](solar-system.md) billions of years ago. Nearly all of this [conduit's](/cosmology/conduit.md) history took place on the 2nd planet from the sun, also called Abrecis.

Additionally, there were multiple accessible subconduits, including [The Unfathomable Night](subconduits/unfathomable-night.md).
