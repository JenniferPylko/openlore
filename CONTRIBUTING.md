# Contributing

If you notice an inconsistency or missing information, you can submit an issue. If you are looking for lore within a specific genre and none of the settings fit, submit an issue. If you find any content that appears *not* to be in the public domain, submit an issue.

If you'd like to add to Open Lore, fork the repo then submit a pull request. Note that I will only accept pull requests that meet the following requirements:

 - [x] Any content created by you is marked with CC0 or an equivalent license that places it in the public domain.
 - [x] Any content not created by you is in the public domain. For example, you could potentially borrow concepts from existing ancient mythologies, but you could not include anything from someone's copyrighted retelling.
 - [x] Your contributions do not contradict existing content or themselves, as far as you or I can tell. The exception to this is that people *in-lore* could be wrong about stuff, so in-lore "sources" may contradict each other. The key concept here is *verisimilitude*.
 - [x] Your contributions are reasonably well-formatted and well-written. I realize that this is pretty subjective, so if I don't think the pull request meets these requirements we can have a discussion about it.
 - [x] Your contributions are a good fit for Open Lore. Like the previous point, this one's also subjective, and we can discuss it.

If your pull request doesn't meet all of those requirements, it's not a big deal: **you're still free to do whatever you want with Open Lore content!** Not meeting these requirements just means your changes won't make it back upstream.

## Tips

I highly recommend using VSCode to read and edit this repository. The `Markdown All in One` and `md-graph` extensions are super useful, and dictionary entries for `Code Spell Checker` are included in `.vscode/settings.json`.

I know many people like Obsidian.md, but I can't personally vouch for it and I don't know if it will work well for this project.
