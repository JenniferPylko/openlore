# Cosmology

## Multiverse Structure

The entire multiverse can be thought of as a great waterfall of time, energy, space, and life cascading from the origin to the void. Everything that exists is formed from the vortices, turbulence, and eddies of this current. Any area within this multiverse but outside an individual universe is known as aetherspace. Individual universes are called [conduits](#conduits) can contain multiple subconduits, dimensions, realms, planes, or whatever you want to call them. These dimensions can exhibit a number of different physical properties, as described [here](dimension-types.md).

## Conduits

The origin's energy crystallizes into boundaries that divert the time-stream's flow, forming individual universes, or [conduits](conduits/introduction.md). The conduit walls separate the universe from the outside multiverse.

## The Origin and The Void

The origin and void aren't so much places someone can go as forces that control the form of the multiverse.

### The Origin

The origin is a great infinite energy potential that produces space, matter, energy, and time. Travel to the origin isn't really possible: approaching essentially "burns up" whatever piece of reality draws near. That's if something can even get close enough to experience that effect. Approaching the origin takes exponentially more energy as the distance is closed.

### The Void

The void is the complete opposite: energy is drawn out of anything that approaches, leaving it frozen and lifeless. Additionally, spacetime quantizes near the void, so layers of aberrant realms precede the void, dilating space and time to appear infinite unless bypassed. Even if someone could bypass these spacetime strata, the void exists in the far future, at the end of the multiverse. The structure of certain conduits allows black holes to form within them. These singularities pull in matter, and deposit it in the void, where entropy will act upon it until the multiverse ceases to be.

## The Divine Realm

Above the time stream, [deities](../deities/introduction.md) exist within the divine realm. Lesser deities might only interact with a single conduit, but greater deities may have influence over several.
