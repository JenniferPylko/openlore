Cogkane was a region on Warble-d with parallels to real-life Europe. Once Warble was connected to the multiverse, Cogkane remained, as far as technology, in its early industrial revolution era for centuries, but with magic to significantly increase quality of life for the average person.

## Currency

Individual countries have their own currencies, but Cogkane mints coins too, and even outside of the region these coins are generally accepted. Cogkane mints bronze coins called "birds", pewter coins called "cogs", and brass coins called "songs". 1 song is 10 cogs, and 1 cog is 10 birds.
