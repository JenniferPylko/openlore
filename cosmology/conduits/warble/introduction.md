Warble was a conduit that became a hub of multiversal travel. It was home to many species of the multiverse.

## Solar System

The solar system was a unary star system surrounded by several planets in the following order.

1. Harmony
2. Melody
3. Warble (or Warble-d to differentiate from the conduit)
4. Tone
5. Timbre

Additionally, the sun was called Song and Warble-d's single moon was called Silence.

Warble-d was the primary destination for a large portion of history, until people started building spaceports on Tone.
