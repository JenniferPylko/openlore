Warble was a conduit that became a hub of multiversal travel. It was home to many species of the multiverse, though humans were the primary anthropoids early in the conduit's history. [Factions](factions/introduction.md) from Warble often developed a presence in other conduits as well.

The primary planet of the [solar system](solar-system/introduction.md) was [Warble-d](solar-system/warble-d/introduction.md).
