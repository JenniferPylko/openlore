# Solar System

<meta property="og:description" content="Regions of Warble, mostly on Warble-d and Tone.">

The solar system was a unary star system surrounded by several planets in the following order.

1. Harmony
2. Melody
3. [Warble](warble-d/introduction.md) (or Warble-d to differentiate from the conduit)
4. Tone
5. Timbre

Additionally, the sun was called Song and Warble-d's single moon was called Silence.

Warble-d was the primary location of anthropoid activity for most of history, but connection to the multiverse led to the building of spaceports on Tone.
