![Warble-d](atlas.png)

Early in its history, Warble-d generally had 1 nation per region, with each nation and region separated by vast areas of wilds, which were inhabited by dangerous creatures and spirits. Later on, magic and industrialization led to human occupation of most available land, as well as connection to the multiverse. Landmasses were grouped into 4 continents, which all used weak proper names.

## Continents

- [The Blear](blear/introduction.md)
- [The Chalice](chalice/introduction.md)
- [The Far](far/introduction.md)
- [The Radiance](radiance/introduction.md)

## Satellites

Warble-d had a single moon, which had different names in different regions of the world, but was called Silence in the north Radiance.

## Calendar

Warble-d matched prototype earth in rotation, orbit, and procession, meaning 1 day was 24 hours and 1 year was 365 days (plus leap years). The Cogkane calendar was widely adopted, which had 10 months of 36 days and a 5 day (plus leap days) intercalary celebration of the new year in early spring. The months were called Thaln, Eoch, Jirl, Met, Tsotar, Uve, Drynt, Ira, Karu, and Thull.

## Creatures

In addition to most of the same creatures as prototype earth (that is, real life creatures), Warble-d was home to many fantastical creatures, particularly [Ichoria](../../../../../taxonomy/illustrati/incorporia/anima/ichoria/introduction.md).
