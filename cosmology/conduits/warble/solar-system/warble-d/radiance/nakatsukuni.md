Nakatsukuni was a region of Warble-d inspired by japanese history and mythology. Nakatsukuni's culture was mostly pantheistic, and spirits were a common sight. The region was composed of 3 main islands. The southernmost was the least developed, the central one was largely dedicated to agriculture, and the northernmost tended toward urbanization.

## Religion

The people of Nakatsukuni built tori'i across the islands where they worshipped various spirits, which were most commonly nature spirits. People from Nakatsukuni who moved to [Cogkane](cogkane/introduction.md) often joined the [Verdant Ascetics](../../../factions/verdant-ascetics.md). Unlike the Cogkane tendency to taxonomize spirits, the people of Nakatsukuni tended to name and worship individual spirits.
