<meta property="og:description" content="Cogkane member nations">

## Ione

Ione was a far-west nation of Cogkane. Rather than establish any military body of its own, Ione has close relations with the central Cogkane infantry. Ionian citizens enlist directly in the Cogkane military.

## Kyanium

Kyanium was the farthest east nation of Cogkane. Legislation by the parliament of Kyanium was often promoted to international Cogkane law due to the nation's influence.

Kyanium existed on resource-rich land, meaning their exports were largely coal, minerals, and metal. Kyanium developed a large mining industry, and consequently, metallurgical and alchemical innovations. Alchemy research became a common area of academic study among mages, establishing Kyanium as a hub of the arcane.

Kyanium Central City, the capital, was built on the western shore of the Kyan gulf.
