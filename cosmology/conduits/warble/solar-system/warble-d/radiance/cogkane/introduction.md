Cogkane was a region on Warble-d made up of [several nations](./member-nations.md) with parallels to real-life Europe. Once Warble was connected to the multiverse, Cogkane remained, as far as technology, in its early industrial revolution era for centuries, but with magic to significantly increase quality of life for the average person.

Most Cogkane religion was focused on worship of deities in a polytheistic sense and had little of the pantheistic culture common in other areas of Warble. Thus, spirits were rarely encountered within the region.

## Currency

Individual countries had their own currencies, but Cogkane minted coins too, and even outside of the region these coins were generally accepted. Cogkane minted bronze coins called "birds", pewter coins called "cogs", and brass coins called "songs". 1 song is 10 cogs, and 1 cog is 10 birds.

## Religion

Several multiversal gods had followers within Cogkane, including [Horkos](../../../../../../../deities/pantheons/superi-vulgati/horkos.md), [Karun](../../../../../../../deities/pantheons/superi-vulgati/karun.md), [Televath](../../../../../../../deities/pantheons/superi-vulgati/televath.md), and [Thullanoth](../../../../../../../deities/pantheons/superi-vulgati/thullanoth.md).

In other areas and less commonly in Cogkane, people built shrines and worshipped spirits. [The Verdant Ascetics](../../../../factions/verdant-ascetics.md) fell in this category.

The Trifulgoris, or the 3 flames of the world, is a symbol composed of the glyphs for divinity, spirit, and mortality. It was widely used in Cogkane as a symbol of sanctity and to bring good fortune.

## International Relations

During the times of the wilds, Cogkane was only regularly in contact with [Thioda](../thioda.md). Xenophobia was high during this period, so Thioda was seen mostly as a threat.
