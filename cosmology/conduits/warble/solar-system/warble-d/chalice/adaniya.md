Adaniya was the continent-spanning outer nation of The Chalice formed after the fall of The Empire Animorum. The inhabitants were warped by the power of the awoken Thousand Worm, acquiring Ichoria traits such as pointed ears, gaunt features, and indefinite lifespans. Adaniyans referred to themselves as "Children of Siwinil" and had their own pantheon.

Adaniya's people believed [Damar's](damar.md) inhabitants to be various types of evil creatures, such as undead, demons, or simply monstrous spirits. Consequently, they maintained physical and magical defenses around the Damar crater.

Adaniya's residents worshipped the [The Nadhil Pantheon](../../../../../../deities/pantheons/nadhil/introduction.md), primarily [Surinil](../../../../../../deities/pantheons/nadhil/surinil.md).
