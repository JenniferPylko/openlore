Damar was the central area of The Chalice following the fall of The Empire Animorum. The Damari were warped by the power of The Thousand Worm to possess great physical strength, pointed ears, exaggerated canine teeth, and skin colors of various earth tones.

Damar was an enormous crater that measured approximately 300 kilometers in diameter. Due to the northern latitude of The Chalice and the depth of the crater, Damar only received direct sunlight from [the third week of Uve through the second week of Ira](../introduction.md#calendar). The limited vegetation that could be cultivated relied on magical light sources, and fungus became a staple.

The steep grade outside the center of the crater meant that many communities had a degree of verticality in their architecture.

The central city of Tadmir was able to develop culturally, scientifically, magically, and academically over the years.

Damar had to defend itself against regular [Adaniyan](adaniya.md) incursions.

Adaniya's residents worshipped the [The Nadhil Pantheon](../../../../../../deities/pantheons/nadhil/introduction.md), primarily [Siwinil](../../../../../../deities/pantheons/nadhil/siwinil.md).
