Warble changed drastically throughout its history, and as such that history is divided into several ages.

## The Dawn Age

At first, the world of Warble-d slept. [Tsotarmateht](../../../../deities/tsotarmateht.md) worked, creating The Thousand Worms to form the land and sea and shaping the would-be inhabitants to match the state of [prototype earth](../../prototype-earth.md). The [Ichoria](../../../../taxonomy/illustrati/incorporia/anima/ichoria/introduction.md) were a project of [Eochan](../../../../deities/eochan.md) and [Dryntir](../../../../deities/dryntir.md), bringing life to that which might otherwise be relegated to the domain of dreams. With preparation over, the deities withdrew and The Thousand Worms burrowed deep, to sleep below the planet's mantle indefinitely.

Humans were placed in [The Chalice](../solar-system/warble-d/chalice/introduction.md) and transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agrarian society. They called themselves The Empire Animorum. Ichoria spirits were rare at first, but their presence in the world grew alongside humanity's.

## The Lost Age

Emperor Cornelius Animorum III had a restless desire for expansion, and his descendants inherited his hunger. He led humanity to global colonization, aided by great mages and arcane innovation.

Mages learned of afterlives and other dimensions, but travel outside Warble's core dimension eluded them.

The great mage Olam believed that summoning one of The Thousand Worms was necessary for the study of magic to truly progress, and devised a ritual that involved sacrificing 1000 humans and 1000 spirits. It worked, in a manner of speaking. One of The Thousand Worms woke from its rest, and, despairing at such an atrocity, killed Olam and razed The Empire Animorum. This Worm awoke multitude spirits to keep the fragmented and fractured remains of humanity in check. Power exhausted, it coiled around The Chalice. Its body faded and it became an everlasting storm surrounding the continent.

The whole of the planet was now wild and untamed. A land of spirits and phenomena.

## The Wild Age

Human communities held on, and even began to grow. Their expansion was much slower than it had been, as they now had to contend with the dense wilds of spirits.
