The Verdant Ascetics formed small communities in [Cogkane](../solar-system/warble-d/radiance/cogkane/introduction.md) and [Thioda](../solar-system/warble-d/radiance/cogkane/introduction.md) at the edge of the wilds. Their communities were based around reverence for the spirits of the wilds, and each community usually focused on a single type of spirit, such as plant spirits, water spirits, fire spirits, or beast spirits.
