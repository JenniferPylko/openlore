The Oria were a group of hunters that defended civilization against magical threats. Most of them did not wield magic (though there were some who received power from a deity or similar), but they were quite resistant to magic. They could also perceive magic as various colors, an ability known as "Orion's sight", depending on the type and intensity. A side effect of this magical sight was achromatopsia: they could not perceive actual colors, and everything was blurry and overly bright. To cope with this condition, they tended to prefer the darkness, and would often wear darkened goggles during the day.

An individual member of The Oria was called an Orion. An Orion's life was often solitary, and they were regarded with some unease by others. An Orion usually had 1 or more animal companions, traditionally hunting dogs. Oria who lived in relatively safe areas, were getting old for the profession, or had suffered a serious injury would often train an apprentice, rarely more than 1 at a time.

The Oria were one of the few factions that had an international (and even rarer, intercontinental) presence during the time of the wilds.
