# Kyanium Sentinels

The Kyanium Sentinels were a humanitarian and military organization within Kyanium. They used magic to aid citizens of [Cogkane](../solar-system/warble-d/radiance/cogkane/introduction.md) as well as defend its borders against wilds creatures and [Thioda](../solar-system/warble-d/radiance/thioda.md).

The Sentinels were part of the broader Cogkane military, but operated with a mostly separate chain of command. Sentinels could generally give commands to infantry members as long as those commands didn't conflict with other orders.

The Sentinels had a very simple command structure: the lowest ranked soldiers were simply called Sentinels. The next rank was Seer, followed by Watcher. The highest rank was Vigilant. The number of Vigilants did not remain constant, sometimes as few as 1 but other times close to 100.
