# Prototype Earth

<meta property="og:description" content="Prototype Earth is the conduit developed by Ere and Elfemroth as the basis of many others.">

Creating suitable mortals who could worship deities took a lot of experimentation. [Ere](../../deities/ere.md) and [Elfemroth](../../deities/elfemroth.md) managed to create such mortals in a massive conduit containing an expansive universe. This conduit was the prototype of many duplicates, some just as large, some pared down to the size of a single solar system. [Softlight](softlight/introduction.md) was one of the nearly-identical enormous duplicates, and [Abrecis](abrecis/introduction.md) was one of the smaller conduits.

Once the mortals of prototype earth were deemed suitable for the task of worshipping deities, the conduit was cut off from the multiverse as a means of preserving it in its known working state. Further experimentation was carried out on duplicates of prototype earth.
