Scintarch was founded in Georgia in 2074 by Ken Ibara and Albert Roe. Former employees of a large military contractor, they secured funding on the pitch of competing with [Softlight's](softlight-corp.md) cybernetics business. They also received a multi-million dollar grant from the government as incentive for competition within that market.

Like Softlight, Scintarch built [smart cities](../smart-cities.md) and [floating cities](../floating-cities.md). After the Moment War, Scintarch gained control of much of what was left of North America's eastern seaboard.

As leverage against Softlight's proprietary approach, Scintarch focused on compatibility between systems.
