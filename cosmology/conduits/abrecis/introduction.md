# Abrecis

Abrecis (adj. Abrecian) was a world full of magic that fell into ruin as a result of the actions of its inhabitants. Any story taking place before or during the [Hematic era](history/eras/hematic.md) will be tinged a shade darker than a fantasy story may normally be, due to the presence or inevitability of the [Hematic wars](history/wars/introduction.md#hematic-wars). The [geography](geography/introduction.md) shifted very suddenly on multiple occasions.

Abrecis had many [nations](organizations/nations/introduction.md), [religions](organizations/religions/introduction.md), and [peoples](inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md) throughout its history.

## The System

Abrecis had 2 [moons](system/moons/introduction.md): [Shaj](system/moons/shaj.md) and [Nyvol](system/moons/nyvol.md). The moons played a part in the [Abrecian hybrid calendar system](calendar.md), with their orbital procession each marking multi-year cycles.

The [great primordial entity](inhabitants/deities/creator.md) created the sun and [planets](system/other-planets/introduction.md) of the [Abrecis system](system/introduction.md) billions of years ago. Nearly all of this [conduit's](../introduction.md) history took place on the 2nd planet from the sun, also called Abrecis.

Additionally, there were multiple accessible subconduits, including [The Unfathomable Night](system/subconduits/unfathomable-night.md).

## Influences

While Abrecis is not Earth, it takes quite a bit of influence from real history and mythology. For example, [Glassvale](system/subconduits/glassvale.md) is heavily based on the mythology of the British isles. Everything is intended to be respectful of real-world cultures, but if any aspect of Abrecis' story is not so, please submit an issue on GitHub. Open Lore is meant to be as inclusive as possible.
