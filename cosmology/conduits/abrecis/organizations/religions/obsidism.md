# Obsidism

Obsidism was the state religion of the [Holy Obsidian Theocracy](../nations/holy-obsidian-theocracy.md) and the last major religion of Abrecis as of the [Obsidic Era](../../history/eras/obsidic.md). The religion worshipped [Obsidis](../../inhabitants/deities/obsidis.md) and started out mostly made up of those who followed [her as a mortal](../../inhabitants/figures/obsidis.md).

## Funerary Rites

Funerals would usually be performed with the body out for the attendees to see. After the funeral, the body would be cremated and the ashes deposited into the ocean. Far inland this necessitated transport of the ashes to the coast by courier, where the local government or Obsidian church would handle them.
