# Religions

The first religions on Abrecis were pantheistic. That is, worshipping part of the natural world as gods.

After the [split](../../history/cataclysms/caers-mistake.md) of the [Ashenal](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/ashenal.md) into many [different species](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md), pantheistic faith sublimated into many polytheistic religions. During the [First Hematic War](../../history/wars/first-hematic.md) [Ethrenal](../../inhabitants/figures/ethrenal.md) persecuted these religions, and they were eventually eliminated by [Obsidis](../../inhabitants/figures/obsidis.md) during the [Second Hematic War](../../history/wars/second-hematic.md).
