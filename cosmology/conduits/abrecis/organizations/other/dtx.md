# DTX

[Daithian](../../geography/continents/daithia.md) Transport Express (DTX) was the railroad of the Daithian frontier, as well as one of the largest railroad corporations in the world.

## History

The company was created in 1589 OA by [Cooper Tingward](../../inhabitants/figures/cooper-tingward.md) as a horseback courier service. In 1603, 2 years after the invention of the steam locomotive, the company took out several enormous loans in order to purchase land, materials, and labor to build a railroad. DTX initially hauled its own freight, but began renting out cargo space to other companies in 1607, and added passenger cars in 1610. By 1612 the company's primary income stream was transporting other companies' freight, so DTX sold off the courier services division of the company, completing the transition to railroad corporation.
