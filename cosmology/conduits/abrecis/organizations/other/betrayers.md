# The Betrayers

<meta property="og:description" content="The Betrayers was the name given to 2 separate groups who eventually merged into a single group.">

The Betrayers was the name given to 2 separate groups who eventually merged into a single group: The Betrayers of [Ethrenal](../../inhabitants/figures/ethrenal.md) and The Betrayers of [Obsidis](../../inhabitants/figures/obsidis.md). The Betrayers would ritualistically sever their ears, as ears were the only reliable way of distinguishing a few of the most common [anthropoid](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md) species, particularly humans and [Ashenal](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/ashenal.md). Much later, The [Stewards](stewards.md) would refer to The Betrayers as The Founders.
