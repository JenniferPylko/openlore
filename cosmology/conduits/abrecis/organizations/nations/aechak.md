Aechak was a nation of [Meshar](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/meshar.md) in northwest [Sangura](../../geography/continents/sangura.md).

## Origins

During the [nomadic era](../../history/eras/nomadic.md), Aechak started out as a group of associated Meshar villages. Due to their mostly carnivorous diet, Meshar communities tended to end up with a surplus of furs, which they traded with [Yalholm](yalholm.md) to the north. Yalholm spanned hundreds of kilometers of coastline, so Aechak was able to purchase goods coming into port. Key among these goods was salt, which enabled food preservation, so Aechak hunters could bring back even more meat without worrying about it spoiling. This caused the population to grow incredibly quickly, and Aechak grew wealthy.

## Industry

Aechak's prosperity led to industrialization. Coal and iron mines were constructed across the eastern region of the nation.
