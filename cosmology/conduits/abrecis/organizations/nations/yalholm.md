# Yalholm

Yalholm was an [Auergel](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/auergel.md) nation on the northwest coast of [Sangura](../../geography/continents/sangura.md). The inhabitants of Yalholm were able to use some of the [Ashenal](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/ashenal.md) vessels left from before [Caer's Mistake](../../history/cataclysms/caers-mistake.md) to engage in cross-ocean trade with other coastal communities. They also traded with [Aechak](aechak.md), which bordered Yalholm to the south.
