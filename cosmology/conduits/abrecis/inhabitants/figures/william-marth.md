William Marth was a racketeer from Bethmoor on the east coast of [Daithia](../../geography/continents/daithia.md). After his business partner, Andrew Keats, became more and more paranoid before disappearing one summer, he took the opportunity to retire from crime and moved to the frontier to run a farm.
