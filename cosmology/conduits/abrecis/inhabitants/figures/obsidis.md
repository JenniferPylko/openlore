Obsidis was a [human](../anthropoids/humans.md) who played a key part in ending [the first hematic war](../../history/wars/first-hematic.md) and started [the second hematic war](../../history/wars/second-hematic.md). After the second hematic war ended, she continued to gain power, eventually achieving apotheosis and becoming the deity of [obsidism](../../organizations/religions/obsidism.md), the state religion of [the Holy Obsidian Theocracy](../../organizations/nations/holy-obsidian-theocracy.md).

## Mortal Life

Before the hematic wars, Obsidis was a mage who studied theoretical arcane concepts involving the mixing of [thetic](../../magic.md#thetic) and [catabolic](../../magic.md#catabolic) magic. In her academic pursuits, she achieved what had only been possible for deities: she could grant power to others such that their spells would not produce [miasma](../../miasma.md). She accumulated a certain amount of power ahead of time, which produced miasma, then that power could be used by her or others at a later time without any additional miasma being produced.

## Apotheosis
