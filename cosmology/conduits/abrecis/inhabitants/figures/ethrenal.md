Ethrenal was an [Ashenal](../anthropoids/ashenal.md) who wanted to re-take Abrecis for the Ashenal, killing all other [anthropoid species](../anthropoids/introduction.md). This was known as the [first hematic war](../../history/wars/first-hematic.md). Before that, however, Ethrenal taught magic. Though he didn't originally consciously discriminate against other anthropoids, his school in [Lothia](../../geography/continents/lothia.md) was located in a region with mostly Ashenal inhabitants, followed by humans, so most of his students were as well. He contributed a great amount to the development of [thetic magic](../../magic.md#thetic), and is widely credited with the invention of [phrenic magic](../../magic.md#phrenic) and [catabolic magic](../../magic.md#catabolic).
