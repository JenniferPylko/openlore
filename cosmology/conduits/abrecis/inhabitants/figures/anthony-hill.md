Anthony Hill was a [DTX](../../organizations/other/dtx.md) contractor and former soldier who spearheaded the Westcolumn Mountain Tunneling Project in [1546 OA](../../calendar.md#reckoning). He was exceptionally charismatic, and would give the impression of someone easygoing and earnest. He saw anyone he couldn't charm as a potential threat, and would quickly resort to intimidation and brutality in order to maintain social dominance. As a leader, he heavily relied on fascist rhetoric and propaganda, particularly by causing conflict and then framing a chosen side as the aggressor in order to unify an opposition. He idealized power as a measurement of virtue, and saw those lacking as inferior. Since leaving the [United Daithia](../../organizations/nations/united-daithia.md) army, he envisioned the nation of Formicia, and thought the [western frontier](../../geography/continents/daithia.md#western-frontier) to be the perfect location to build it. Upon encountering the [stewards](../../organizations/other/stewards.md), Hill worked on solidifying power on the western frontier and propagandized himself as a leader against the "cultist" threat.
