# Shaja

The Shaja were a species of [anthropoid](introduction.md) who were commonly 6-8 feet tall, muscular, and had pointed ears, sharp teeth with lower canines that would extend enough to appear as tusks in some individuals, and skin of various earth tones. Many humans and [Ashenal](ashenal.md) stereotyped Shaja as violent, brutish, unintelligent, and non-magical, but any member of most Shaja communities could tell you that such an idea was absurd.

## Major Cultures

The first Shaja appeared in a [ring](../../anthropic-rings.md) around the epicenter of [Caer's Mistake](../../history/cataclysms/caers-mistake.md) about 2 thirds of the way to the other side of the world. As communities split and merged during the [nomadic era](../../history/eras/nomadic.md), Shaja tended to gravitate to a few main ones: a polar nation, an equatorial nation, a desert nation, a coastal nation, and 2 different mainland temperate nations.
