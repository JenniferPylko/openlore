# Cicadians

Cicadians were an [anthropoid](introduction.md) species resembling cicadas. They had strong chitin exoskeletons and 4 arms in addition to glassy wings that aided their movement by enabling large leaps.

## Culture

The Cicadian [ring](../../geography/anthropic-rings.md) was very near the epicenter of [Caer's Mistake](../../history/cataclysms/caers-mistake.md), so the Cicadians were few and had a somewhat monolithic culture.

## In Obsidism

After the [second hematic war](../../history/wars/second-hematic.md), Cicadians became mythologized, and cicadas were used as a symbol of freedom and majesty by [United Daithia](../../organizations/nations/united-daithia.md).
