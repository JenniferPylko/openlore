# Meshar

The Meshar were an anthropoid species whose [ring](../../geography/anthropic-rings.md) (ring 10) passed through [Sangura](../../geography/continents/sangura.md) and [Atrea](../../geography/continents/obsidia.md). They looked similar to [Ashenal](ashenal.md), but typically only grew to 4 feet in height at most. On closer inspection, their teeth were sharper, and they lacked molars to grind their food. Their sight was especially keen, especially in the dim of twilight.

The Meshar nation of [Aechak](../../organizations/nations/aechak.md) in northwest Sangura became known for its industry and innovation, and this is where [The Industrial Union](../../organizations/other/industrial-union.md) began.
