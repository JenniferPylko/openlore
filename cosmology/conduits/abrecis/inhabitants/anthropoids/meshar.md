# Meshar

The Meshar were an anthropoid species whose [ring](../../geography/anthropic-rings.md) (ring 10) passed through [Sangura](../../geography/continents/sangura.md) and [Atrea](../../geography/continents/obsidia.md). They looked similar to [Ashenal](ashenal.md), but typically only grew to 4 feet in height at most.

The Meshar nation of Aechak in northwest Sangura became known for its industry and innovation, and this is where [The Industrial Union](../../organizations/other/industrial-union.md) began.
