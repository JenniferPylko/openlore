# Humans

Humans were the species of anthropoid that remained most similar to the [Ashenal](ashenal.md) in the wake of [Caer's Mistake](../../history/cataclysms/caers-mistake.md). While they looked similar to Ashenal, their skin tones did not include the blue and purple hues of some Ashenal, and their ears were rounded rather than pointed. They also had significantly shorter lifespans, with an upper limit of about 70 [Abrecian years](../../calendar.md#years).

## Culture

The human [anthropic ring](../../geography/anthropic-rings.md) was ring 16, nearly opposite the epicenter of Caer's Mistake, so their cultures were not as significantly varied during the [nomadic era](../../history/eras/nomadic.md) as, for example, the [many shajan cultures](shaja.md#major-cultures).
