# Obsidis (Deity)

## Mortal Life

For information on Obsidis pre-apotheosis, see [Obsidis (Mortal)](../figures/obsidis.md).

## Ascension Miracle

When Obsidis first ascended, she used her newfound power to re-fill the oceans with water and clean the planet of [miasma](../../miasma.md). This un-did much of the environmental damage of the [xerothermic era](../../history/eras/xerothermic.md)

## Symbolic Opposition

Obsidis damned [Ethrenal's](../figures/ethrenal.md) soul to the [Unfathomable Night](../../system/subconduits/unfathomable-night.md) for him to live eternally as a symbol of evil.
