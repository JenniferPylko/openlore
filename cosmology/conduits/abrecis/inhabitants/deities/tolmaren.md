# The Tolmaren

The Tolmaren was an entity, or perhaps group of entities, that controlled [The Unfathomable Night](../../system/subconduits/unfathomable-night.md). Not much was known about it, other than it stole [spirits of the dead](../spirits/dead.md) from other subconduits, and guarded anyone and anything against escape.
