Many of the deities of Abrecis were also deities in other conduits, but once Abrecis was cut off from the rest of the multiverse only [Obsidis](obsidis.md) remained present. The other deities fled across the multiverse. In doing so, the Sisters of War perished, but Morgan, claiming to be Danu, gained followers. The Tolmaren established cults across the multiverse.
