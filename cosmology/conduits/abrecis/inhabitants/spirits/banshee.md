# Banshees

Banshees were a type of spirit native to [Glassvale](../../system/subconduits/glassvale.md) who served [Danu](../deities/sisters-of-war.md#danu). Their wailing screams were meant to guide [spirits of the dead](dead.md) to [Hy-Bresail](../../system/subconduits/glassvale.md#hy-bresail). Mortals, anthropoid and beast alike, would feel overcome with doom and dread at the sound of a banshee's scream.
