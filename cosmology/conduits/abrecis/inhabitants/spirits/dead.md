When a sapient mortal dies, particularly an [anthropoid](../anthropoids/introduction.md), the release of energy separating the soul from the body would encapsulate the soul in magic. This new structure was called a spirit, an initially weak afterimage of the mortal it once was, but an entity can change and grow over time.
