# Spirits of the Dead

When a sapient mortal dies, particularly an [anthropoid](../anthropoids/introduction.md), the release of energy separating the soul from the body encapsulates the soul in magic. This new structure is a spirit, which is initially a weak afterimage of the mortal it once was, but can change and grow over time.

## Revenants

If a spirit of the dead animates a corpse, this facsimile of a living being is called a revenant.
