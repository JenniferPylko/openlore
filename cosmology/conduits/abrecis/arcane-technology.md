# Arcana and Technology

[Magic](magic.md) and technology were constantly intertwined throughout the history of Abrecis. In truth, the arcane could be viewed as fields of science and engineering.

## Travel

### Seafaring

Toward the end of the [oceanic era](history/eras/oceanic.md) (relatively speaking) the [Ashenal](inhabitants/anthropoids/ashenal.md) built the first sailing ships.

### Land travel

The Ashenal used animal-pulled carts far back into the oceanic era. Some [shamanic magic](history/eras/shamanic.md) enabled rudimentary communication with animals, improving this method of transportation.

[Thetic magic](history/eras/thetic.md) enabled quicker and stronger construction of vehicles, in addition to enchantment power.

[Phrenic magic](history/eras/phrenic.md) was used for long-distance travel. Mages would use phrenic magic to rotate a crank, which propelled the vehicle forward. This required constant active attention, but mages could switch out over the course of the journey.
