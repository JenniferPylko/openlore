# Miasmatic Era

<meta property="og:description" content="All anthropoids dwindled in number throughout this era due to the harsh conditions of the global desert and atmospheric miasma.">

All [anthropoids](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md) dwindled in number throughout this era due to the harsh conditions of the global desert and atmospheric [miasma](../../miasma.md). It seemed as though this was was the twilight of Abrecis, until[Obsidis](../../inhabitants/deities/obsidis.md) repaired the environment, beginning the [anabatic era](anabatic.md). The commonly accepted beginning of this era was -615 PY, and there was a consensus that the era ended in -1213 PY/0 OA.
