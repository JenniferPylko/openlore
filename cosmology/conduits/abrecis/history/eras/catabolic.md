# Catabolic Era

The catabolic era began with [Ethrenal's](../../inhabitants/figures/ethrenal.md) development of [catabolic magic](../../magic.md#catabolic), which quickly eclipsed other forms of magic in power and capability, causing it to become the primary magic used.

One of the main benefits of catabolic magic was that it could be integrated into machines more easily than other magic, leading to the development of teleportation gates, various arcane-powered land, air, and sea vehicles, enhanced armor, and many other combinations of magic and mechanisms.

As the use of catabolic magic increased, so did its impact on the inhabitants and environment of Abrecis due to absorbing life energy and producing [miasma](../../miasma.md). During the [hematic wars](../wars/introduction.md#hematic-wars) this effect accelerated, transforming the whole world into desert.
