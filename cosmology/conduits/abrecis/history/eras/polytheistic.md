With the split of the [Ashenal](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/ashenal.md) into many different [anthropoid species](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md), religions worshipping different gods developed. This is in contrast to [the pantheistic era](pantheistic.md) when the forces of nature were worshipped as gods.
