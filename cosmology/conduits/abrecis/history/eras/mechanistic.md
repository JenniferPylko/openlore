# Mechanistic Era

After Obsidis took away all [anthropoids'](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md) ability to use shamanic (and therefore catabolic) [magic](../../magic.md), eliminated all knowledge of phrenic magic, and had replaced all other deities capable of granting thetic magic, technology was entirely based on physical interactions. For a long time, tools and machines were mostly mechanical, and after hundreds of years steam technology enabled faster expansion across the continents. It was commonly agreed that this era began in -984 PY.
