# Thetic Era

The thetic era was the period of time when magic was primarily a gift granted by gods. This era ended as the [religions of Abrecis](../../organizations/religions/introduction.md) waned and [phrenic magic](../../magic.md#phrenic) came to prominence during the [phrenic age](phrenic.md). The commonly accepted endpoints of this era were -118 PY to -519 PY.
