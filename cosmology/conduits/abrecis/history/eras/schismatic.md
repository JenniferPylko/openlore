# Schismatic Era

This era began as the direct result of [Caer's Mistake](../cataclysms/caers-mistake.md). It was characterized by a massive increase in biodiversity in the terrestrial ecosystem as well as many new [anthropoids](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md). Though some of this occurred due to the changing distribution of land vs ocean, it was mostly a direct result of the mutagenic effect of the magic involved in Caer's Mistake. There was a consensus that this era began in 0 PY, and it was commonly accepted that it ended in -602 PY.
