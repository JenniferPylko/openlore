# Atavistic Era

The atavistic era was a period of global recovery. With near-total extinction of multicellular life on Abrecis occurring during the [xerothermic era](xerothermic.md), the actions of [Obsidis](../../inhabitants/deities/obsidis.md) to restore the oceans and cleanse the atmosphere effected a reversal of the gradual decline of biological populations and diversity. It was commonly agreed that this era began in -1097 PY.

The restoration of the oceans and atmosphere didn't immediately bring Abrecis back to its previous state, and much of the planet's dry land remained desert. Low biodiversity combined with the rapid change in environment meant that some species died out and some proliferated in an almost invasive fashion.
