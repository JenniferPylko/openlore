# Second Hematic War

> *You, humans, are all there is. You are all there has ever been.*  
> -Obsidis

The second hematic war began at the tail end of [the first](first-hematic.md). [Obsidis'](../../inhabitants/figures/obsidis.md) forces declared victory over [Ethrenal](../../inhabitants/figures/ethrenal.md), but Obsidis wanted revenge. So, she enacted total war against [Lothia](../../organizations/nations/lothia.md). Over the next few years, this attrition expanded to include all non-human [anthropoids](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md), as well as history of non-human cultures. Vengeance had become genocide.
