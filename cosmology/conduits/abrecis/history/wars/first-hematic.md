The first hematic war was a genocidal campaign initiated by [Ethrenal](../../inhabitants/figures/ethrenal.md). The goal of Ethrenal and his forces was to retake for the [Ashenal](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/ashenal.md), and subjugate, enslave, or eliminate [everyone else](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md). In addition, Ethrenal had dolmens destroyed in order to cut off access to [Glassvale](../../system/subconduits/glassvale.md).
