Nyvol was the smaller of Abrecis' 2 moons, although its greater distance from the planet exaggerated this effect. It was a xanthous orange color, and did not have visible craters.

Nyvol's precession was predictable and in sync with Abrecis' year, forming a 7-year cycle. This was used in [the calendar system](../../calendar.md#lunar-cycles).
