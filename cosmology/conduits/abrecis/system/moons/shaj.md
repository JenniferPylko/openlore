# Shaj

Shaj was the larger of Abrecis' 2 moons. It would periodically eclipse [Nyvol](nyvol.md) and the sun. It was a dim gray color tinged slightly violet, and had several large and visible craters.

Shaj's precession was predictable and in sync with Abrecis' year, forming a 3-year cycle. This was used in [the calendar system](../../calendar.md#lunar-cycles).

The [Shaja](../../inhabitants/anthropoids/shaja.md) took their name from this moon.
