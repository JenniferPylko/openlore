The Obsidian Domain was a subconduit created by [Obsidis](../../inhabitants/deities/obsidis.md) for her to inhabit and accumulate the [spirits](../../inhabitants/spirits/dead.md) of her dead followers. It made its way into the mythology of [Obsidism](../../organizations/religions/obsidism.md) as the desired afterlife. Obsidis maintained a single connection to [the unfathomable night](unfathomable-night.md), where she sent problematic spirits.
