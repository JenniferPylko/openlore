# Sangura

The continent of Sangura lay directly north of [Daithia](daithia.md), separated by a strait known as *the scar*. [Obsidia](../../organizations/nations/holy-obsidian-theocracy.md) colonized this continent in the late [1400s OA](../../calendar.md#reckoning), and the [nation of Sangura](../../organizations/nations/sangura.md) gained independence in the 1638 OA.
