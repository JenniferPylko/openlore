Distance from the epicenter of [Caer's Mistake](../history/cataclysms/caers-mistake.md) transformed Ashenal into certain [anthropoid](../inhabitants/anthropoids/introduction.md) species, so those who remained Ashenal on the opposite side of the planet long existed as a mostly monolithic culture, while those in between such as the [Meshar](../inhabitants/anthropoids/meshar.md) and [Shaja](../inhabitants/anthropoids/shaja.md) developed several wildly different cultures individually.
