# Geography

## Continents

There have been a few different terrestrial layouts throughout the planet's history. The first era where Abrecis could properly be considered a planet (post-accretion) was the [Volcanic era](../history/eras/volcanic.md). There was a dearth of liquid water, and the entire Abrecian surface was mostly rock and lava.

During the [Oceanic era](../history/eras/oceanic.md) there were no large landmasses, only islands that would later become mountains.

During the [Xerothermic era](../history/eras/xerothermic.md) there was almost no liquid water on the surface, so rather than continents and ocean there were only highlands and lowlands.

During the [Schismatic](../history/eras/schismatic.md) and [Atavistic](../history/eras/atavistic.md) eras there was vast ocean surrounded by 4 main inhabited landmasses on Abrecis: [Obsidia](continents/obsidia.md), [Sangura](continents/sangura.md), [Lothia](continents/lothia.md), and [Daithia](continents/daithia.md).
