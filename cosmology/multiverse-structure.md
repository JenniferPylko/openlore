# Multiverse Structure

The entire multiverse can be thought of as a great river of time, energy, space, and life flowing from the origin to the void. Everything that exists is formed from the vortices, turbulence, and eddies of this current.

## The Origin and The Void

The origin and void aren't so much places someone can go as forces that control the form of the multiverse.

The origin is a great infinite energy potential that produces space, matter, energy, and time. Travel to the origin isn't really possible: even approaching essentially "burns up" whatever piece of reality draws near. That's if something can even get close enough to experience that effect. Approaching the void takes exponentially more energy as the distance is closed.

The void is the complete opposite: energy is drawn out of anything that approaches, leaving it frozen and lifeless. Additionally, spacetime quantizes near the void, so layers of aberrant realms precede the void, dilating space and time to appear infinite unless bypassed.

## Conduits

The origin's energy crystallizes into boundaries that divert the time-stream's flow, forming individual universes, or conduits. The conduit walls separate the universe from the outside multiverse.

## Flux

## The Divine Realm

Above the time stream, [deities](../deities/introduction.md) exist within the divine realm. Lesser deities might only interact with a single conduit, but greater deities may have influence over several.
