The Archive was a multiverse-spanning organization with mysterious goals and hooks in the workings of many universes. Most members of the Archive were referred to as agents.

The Archive aligned most with the Abstract, Material, Ordered, and Occult points of the [clock of being](clock-of-being.md).

## Pursuits

### Exploration

The Archive dedicated significant resources to mapping the known multiverse and documenting notable locations.

### Iconoclasm

The Archive held a special interest in killing deities, and went to great lengths to acquire knowledge on the subject. Despite this, the Archive worked closely with deities on other ventures.

### Storage

The Archive would find artifacts of magical import from anywhere they could, inventory them, and store them in secure locations.

### Quarantine

Large scale threats were regularly quarantined by the Archive. These could be rogue deities, corrupted universes, or any number of multiverse phenomena.
