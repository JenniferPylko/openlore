Umbra is a domain within Necrobiota that includes creatures animated by void energy which were not previously living. Members of Umbra are generally not considered undead in the lay sense. One such example is an umbral pathogen or umbral parasite. These are animated by void energy, but were never a Biota corpse. They will infect Biota hosts, altering them in a way that causes the host to be considered undead, even though it is more accurate to say that the pathogen/parasite is undead rather than the host.
