# System: Necrobiota

<meta property="og:description" content="Necrobiota is a system that includes all true undead.">

Necrobiota is a system that includes all true undead. Some species of Illustrati commonly considered undead may in fact be members of [Biota](../biota/introduction.md), [Fabrica](../fabrica/introduction.md), or [Incorporia](../incorporia/introduction.md).

Examples of things commonly considered undead that are not (or not necessarily) Necrobiota include the following.

- Animals infected by behavior-altering pathogens or parasites, often called "zombies"
- Type II previously-dead deities
- Digital ghosts
- Flesh constructs
- Spirits of the dead
- Vampires

One clue to classification is that true undead cannot hybridize with members of Biota through intrinsic reproductive processes. For example, the existence of Dhampirs precludes the possibility of Vampires being undead. Of note, however, is the possibility that reproduction involves still-living cells. A male human that becomes a revenant could impregnate a female human due to the potential presence of still-living sperm. In this case, the offspring would be a human, not a revenant-human hybrid.

Members of Necrobiota are animated by negative life energy, or [void](../../../cosmology/introduction.md#the-void) energy, which is equivalent to time-reversed origin energy.

Necrobiota includes the following domains.

- [Simulacra](simulacra/introduction.md)
- [Umbra](umbra/introduction.md)
- [Viscera](viscera/introduction.md)
