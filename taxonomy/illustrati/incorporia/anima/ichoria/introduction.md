Ichoria is a kingdom within Anima that describes a wide range of spirits which manifest a physical form. The name comes from Ichor, the pale-violet fluid that circulated within the bodies of many creatures of this kingdom. With few exceptions, members of Ichoria did not have the innate ability to alter the form of their physical manifestation. The more intelligent among them could learn to maintain a magical glamour, appearing mundane to humans.
