A lemet is an amphibious creature that can grow up to about 1 meter long, including the length of its arms. It resembles the common octopus, but lacks suckers. Each arm ends with a curved, hardened claw, earning it the common name "hooktopus". It is highly mobile both in water and on land, where it can anchor itself with 1 or more claws and swing the rest of its body around.
