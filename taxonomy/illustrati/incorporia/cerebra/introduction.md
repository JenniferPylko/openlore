# Domain: Cerebra

Cerebra refers to the minds or souls of all living things. Members of Cerebra don't usually exist on their own, but in a symbiotic relationship with members of another domain or system. Conscious organic life is a combination of [Biota](../../biota/introduction.md) and Cerebra. Some spirits were a combination of [Anima](../anima/introduction.md) and Cerebra. More complex undead incorporated [Necrobiota](../../necrobiota/introduction.md) and Cerebra.
